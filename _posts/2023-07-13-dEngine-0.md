So this is going to mark the start of my dev blog for [dEngine](2023-07-03-dengine).  I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to start keeping track of it.  While I don't expect this to be a daily thing, it could help just keeping my motivation up and being true to myself.

I started dEngine just to refresh myself on C++ since I haven't touched it since I was a teenager, and even back then I didn't do a ton with it.  This way I can learn more stuff and do what I like.   The vision for this is to be a simple 2D modular game engine.  One where I can make simple games for myself or my kids and just have fun with it.  I don't expect it to be able to compete with anything like Unreal or Unity, and only expect very simple top down or platform games.  

I am open-sourcing it so that others can play around with it if they want to.  Overall this is just going to be a simple little hobby.  I'm wanting to make it fairly modular as I want to be able to easily decouple the game's code from the engine itself, as well as provide a small set of features.

Currently my idea is to have the following features:

- UI system
- Audio system
- Save/Load system
- Camera system
- Simple networking (multiplayer support)
- Component system
- Automated documentation

Will all of these get completed? Probably not, I'm sure here in a few months after getting it mostly functional I may move on to something else, but we'll see.  

Once I get it to a standard state, I would like to be able to create a simple Diablo like game.   I've already been working on this nearly a month and have a decent amount done, but still nothing substantial, so it'll be interesting to see how far it goes.
