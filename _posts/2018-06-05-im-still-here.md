Well, after a few career adjustments, a new child, and many other developments in my personal life I'm still here and kicking.  Over the past several months I have made huge strides in my personal skill development even finally publishing my first android application yesterday!  I released Discover Brewton on both the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DCCoder.DiscoverBrewton.Android) and the [Amazon App store](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJ18DHV/ref=sr_1_2?s=mobile-apps&ie=UTF8&qid=1528204444&sr=1-2&keywords=brewton).

Discover Brewton is a simple application that gives some insight into my home town and automatically pulls town sponsored events, allowing you to add them to your calendar.  I do my best to attend as many of these as possible so be sure to come and see me!
