So after about 3 years of sticking with Siteground, I decided to finally look for something different. After a while of looking I finally decided to go with Wordpress.com, I mean why not? They have a simple interface, their personal package was over $20 a month cheaper than what I was paying, and I don't have to maintain anything. I guess now I just have to start writing more.

I don't really have a reason for not writing more in my blog, and every year it seems I abandon it only to come back a year later and promise to write more. I'm not making that promise this time, I'll write whenever I feel like it.

Some times I almost feel like I have an obligation to write, to spread knowledge, but recently I had a revelation: I pay for this, receive nothing for doing it, and it's essentially nothing more than my own little place on the web. So if all of that is true, then sorry everyone, you'll just have to bear with me.  
  
But now that I have that out of my system, back to the blog. I've also decided to completely change how the site looks. I want something more simple, something that just gets content across without the need of creating a "personal brand". If you like what I write, feel free to keep coming back! If you don't like what I write, well I guess I'll see you around!
