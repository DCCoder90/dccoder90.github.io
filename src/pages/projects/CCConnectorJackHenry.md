## Overview

This project involved the design and development of an API-based connector to bridge modern cloud technologies with the Jack Henry Symitar core banking platform. Symitar is the leading core processing system for credit unions, serving as the central "system of record" for all member data, transactions, and account information.

The connector was built to provide a flexible, scalable, and secure way to interact with on-premises Symitar data. Its primary application was to power modern telebanking and contact center solutions for credit unions. Key features enabled by this API include member data "screen pops" for agents and providing a data source for self-service IVR  systems. The API was built using a .NET stack and designed for a high-availability AWS environment, following DevOps principles.
