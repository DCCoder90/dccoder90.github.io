## Overview

This project was designed to be my personal portfolio and blog. It is built as a modern, static site using the Astro framework and styled with Tailwind CSS.

The site is structured to serve as both a blog and a portfolio, featuring sections for blog posts (organized by date), a list of projects, an "About" page, and a resume page. The codebase is open source and configured for automated CI/CD, which builds the site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

## Technologies Used

* **Astro**: The core static site generator framework.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling and theme.
* **TypeScript**: Used for type-safe configuration and helper functions.
* **GitHub Actions**: Provides the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
