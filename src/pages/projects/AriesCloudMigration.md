# Overview

This involved the strategic migration of key Aries Systems' components, including Editorial Manager and ProduXion Manager platforms, from an on-premises datacenter to the AWS cloud. The primary purpose was to enhance system performance, scalability, and reliability for global publishing partners, with a critical requirement of maintaining 100% user availability.

This was accomplished through a phased, component-by-component rollout. Beyond the technical execution, the project also involved organizational transformation by developing new project workflows, training engineering teams on DevOps and cloud best-practices, and personally mentoring engineers on AWS-specific development and deployment patterns.
