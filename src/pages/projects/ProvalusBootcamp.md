description: "With the assistance of one of my colleges, I set up and developed the structure of the Provalus developer boot-camp. This was an 8 week course that taught individuals with no prior experience the fundamentals of C#, ASP.NET, CSS, and HTML. My work consisted of utilizing Pluralsight as a supplementary tool with a primary focus on hands on learning and lectures with a relaxed environment."
