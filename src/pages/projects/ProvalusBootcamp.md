# Overview

I co-developed and structured the Provalus developer boot-camp, an intensive 8-week course designed to train individuals with no prior technical experience into job-ready developers. The purpose of this program was to build the core engine for the Provalus business model: creating a skilled, U.S.-based IT workforce in rural American communities as a high-quality, domestic alternative to overseas outsourcing. I accomplished this by designing a comprehensive curriculum that balanced supplementary learning tools (like Pluralsight) with a primary focus on hands-on, instructor-led lectures in a practical, relaxed environment.

# Technologies

The curriculum was structured to provide a foundation in enterprise-level development. The technologies taught included:

* C#
* ASP.NET
* .Net Framework
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JSON
* SQL
