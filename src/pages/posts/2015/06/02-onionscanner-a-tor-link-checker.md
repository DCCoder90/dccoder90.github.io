Well last night I got an idea.  I like to checkout the TOR Hidden Services from time to time but it’s a pain in the tail just trying to find a link that actually works.  So I cooked up the OnionScanner!  It’s basically just a TOR link checker.  But feel free to check it out on the home site or on GitHub and let me know what you think.  If you have some ways to improve on it feel free to put in a request.  Even if you just want to port it to another language to make it cross-platform I would greatly appreciate it!
