It's been a day and forever since I've messed around any with C++ so I decided why not try and get back into it?  It's always good to brush up on skills you've gotten rust (VERY RUSTY) on.   Though I wouldn't say I was ever a master at C++, and I'm sure my work will prove that, I used to be able to do a little here and there.

In order to help me get back on track I figured I'd try my hand at writing a 2D modular game engine.  It's not going to be anything fancy or special, but just enough to let me build some games for the kids or for myself.  Will probably end up adding cross-platform support at a much later date.  But either way, for any curious individuals out there the code can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/DCCoder90/dengine), and the code's documentation can be found on my site on the [dengine page](https://www.dccoder.com/dengine/).
