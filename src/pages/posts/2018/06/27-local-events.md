Living here on the Gulf Coast there is usually a lack of technical meetings, talks, and conferences. The ones that are out there are usually difficult to locate and hidden behind various websites. Due to this and my attempts to further the local IT community I will be posting all local events I come across to my blog. You can find the upcoming ones on the right hand side, or visit the [Events page](http://www.dccoder.com/events/) to see the full calendar.

If you are hosting a local IT event and would like me to post it up, just reach out to me via the [Contact page](http://dccoder.com/contact-me/).
