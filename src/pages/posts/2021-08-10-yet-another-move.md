So yet again I have moved my site.  I spent right at a year hosting everything with Wordpress, but now here we are on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  This move was probably a long time coming, but I finally bit the bullet.  Even though [when I switched to Wordpress](2020-09-04-moving-time.md) it was primarily due to the simplicity of the platform and due to it being a little cheaper, this time it's really due to practicality.  

For the past 4-5 months I've been using [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) for both my personal and my development diary, on top of that I write a LOT of documentation that is displayed in GitHub for work, so it's clear to say that markdown is my primary writing format these days.   

Hosting in GitHub Pages allows me to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to host my site which means that all of my blog posts are now written in markdown.  While I've used it in the past the fact that I use it for nearly everything now, it only makes sense that my blog posts are written in it too.  Github Pages also has the added benefit that it's simply just a repository.   So the website now also gets all the benefits of source control as well which is fairly handy.

On a side note, I've been debating on starting a weekly podcast for about a year now and I think I'm finally ready to go ahead and do it.   Honestly it's really been one of those things of, do I really want to spend the money on all this equipment?  Do I have enough to talk about? etc. etc.  So really I'm just going to work with the stuff I already have, and being in the .NET ecosystem primarily I think I have plenty to talk about, especially with the upcoming release of [.NET 6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-6/). So be on the look out for that! Also, I do have a few drafts that I've been working on for posts here, so they will be coming here before too much longer as well.

One final shoutotu to [Will Boyd](https://github.com/lonekorean) for their [wordpress-export-to-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wordpress-export-to-markdown) package.  That really made this transition painless.
